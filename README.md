# TriviaGame

### The app is a Band Trivia Game.  The game uses Javascript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate the HTML. 

#### How the app works:

1. The trivia form has multiple choice questions.
2. The user is shown only one question at a time until the player answers it or time runs out.
3. If the player selects the correct answer, the screen congratulates them.  After a few seconds, the next question is displayed - without any user input.
4. The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
	- If a player runs out of time, it tells the player that time's up and displays the correct answer.  A few seconds later, the next question is shown.
	- If a player chooses the wrong answer, the player is told that an incorrect selection was made, and the correct answer is displayed.  A few seconds later, the next question is shown.
5. On the final screen, the number of incorrect answers, correct answers, and unanswered questions is shown, and the user has the option to restart the game.
